# Pedestron
Pedestron is an [MMetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) based repository that focuses on the advancement of reserach on pedestrian detection.
We provide processed annotations and scripts to process the annotation of different pedestrian detection benchmarks.


### Installation
We refer to the installation and list of dependencies of MMdetection to the official [installation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) file.
[Clone](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [install](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) mmdetection following the instructions.

### List of detectors

*Currently we provide configurations for Cascade Mask-RCNN  


### Following annotations are provided currently 
* Caltech
* CityPersons
* EuroCity Persons
* CrowdHuman
* WiderPedestrian Challenge


### Preparation
1. Download the datasets from the official sites. 
2. Place them in datasets folder in the follwoing heararchy, for example CityPersons should be (./datsets/CityPersons/images/) and (./datsets/CityPersons/annotations/) 




### Pre-Trained models
1) CityPersons.
2) Caltech.
3) EuroCity Persons
